# RSA_Enc-Dec_DigitalSignature
In today’s fast-moving digital environment, data security and privacy are more critical than ever—especially for global financial institutions. These organizations are responsible for managing highly sensitive information, such as private conversations with clients, financial reports, internal communications, and authentication credentials. If this data falls into the wrong hands, the consequences can be severe ranging from financial losses to reputational damage and legal complications.
#### As this information is transmitted across various networks—some of which may be insecure—it becomes vulnerable to cyber threats. Some of the most common and dangerous threats include:
-	Eavesdropping & Data Interception: Cybercriminals may try to “listen in” on data as it travels across the internet, hoping to steal confidential information.
-	Unauthorized Access: Hackers might attempt to decrypt or access sensitive data without proper permission.
-	Data Tampering: Attackers could intercept and alter the contents of financial transactions or communications, leading to serious integrity issues.
-	Replay Attacks: In this method, a malicious actor captures a valid encrypted message and sends it again to impersonate the original sender or gain unauthorized access.
#### To fight back against these threats and protect their data, the organization is implementing RSA encryption, a well-established cryptographic technique used for secure communication. RSA is especially useful because it ensures that even if a message is intercepted, it cannot be read or tampered with by unauthorized parties.
### With RSA encryption, the institution can achieve several key goals:
-	Confidentiality: Only the intended recipient can read the message.
-	Integrity: The message cannot be altered without detection.
-	Authentication: The recipient can verify the sender’s identity.
-	Secure Key Exchange: RSA enables the safe sharing of encryption keys, making future communication even more secure.
##### RSA encryption is powerful for protecting the content of a message, it does not confirm who sent it or guarantee that it hasn’t been modified. That’s why the organization is taking the next step: integrating digital signatures to strengthen authentication and ensure data integrity.
#### This enhanced approach builds on the strengths of RSA and brings the organization one step closer to truly secure, end-to-end communication in an increasingly dangerous digital landscape.
